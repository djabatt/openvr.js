Open VR intended goals are:

Make it easy to create 3d/2d VR experinces. We want to engineer a set of JavaScript wrappers that abstract great code like 3js and provide CSS/HTML "like" VR scene descriptors.   

This project is being funded by <a href="http://www.wemolab.com/">Wemo Lab</a>.  We want more folks involved.

CSS object loading and editting is working.
Currently working on adding a global SceneEditor to hold all Scene state.
Currently working on adding a View controller for interacting with the Scene.
